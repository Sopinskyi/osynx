    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 21 Oct 2025</p>

    <p>GSA-X is a Google Sheets™ add-on developed by <strong>Ochyro Inc</strong> (“we,” “us,” “our”). This policy explains what data the add-on accesses and how we use it.</p>

    <h2>What the add-on does</h2>
    <p>GSA-X lets you look up Samsara assets in Google Sheets, fetch current locations, and insert deep links that open directly in Samsara.</p>

    <h2>Data we access</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google Sheets data</strong> you select in the spreadsheet where you run the add-on (read/write to the active sheet to populate and refresh rows).</li>
      <li><strong>Basic Google account info</strong> (<code>userinfo.email</code> and, if enabled, <code>userinfo.profile</code>) to show which account is signed in and for support diagnostics.</li>
      <li><strong>Locale</strong> (for formatting labels/timestamps).</li>
      <li><strong>External requests</strong> to the Samsara API you configure (we call <code>https://api.samsara.com/</code> using your API token/Org ID).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we use data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Populate and refresh the current spreadsheet’s rows with Samsara asset information at your request.</li>
      <li>Generate “Open in Samsara” links for convenience.</li>
      <li>Display your signed-in account in the add-on UI and format content per your locale.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where data is stored</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>We do not operate any backend servers for GSA-X and do not store Google user data server-side.</strong></li>
      <li>Your Samsara API token and Org ID are stored locally in the <strong>document properties</strong> of the Google Sheet where you paste them. You can remove them at any time (see “Your choices & deletion”).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sharing & selling</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not sell or rent your data.</li>
      <li>We only send requests to the Samsara API you configure, using your token, to fulfill your explicit actions (lookups/refreshes).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>All communication with Google and Samsara APIs occurs over HTTPS/TLS. Because GSA-X does not use our own servers, there is no server-side database to breach. You control the token stored in your spreadsheet.</p>

    <h2>Your choices & deletion</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Remove credentials:</strong> In the same spreadsheet, delete the add-on’s saved token/Org ID from the settings panel (or clear the document properties).</li>
      <li><strong>Uninstall the add-on:</strong> Google Sheets → Extensions → Manage add-ons → GSA-X → Uninstall.</li>
      <li><strong>Revoke OAuth access:</strong> Google Account → Security → Third-party access → GSA-X → Remove access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Google API Services User Data Policy (Limited Use)</h2>
    <p>GSA-X’s use of Google user data complies with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the <strong>Limited Use</strong> requirements. We only use the minimum necessary scopes to provide the add-on features, do not transfer Google user data except as needed to fulfill the user’s request, and do not use the data for advertising.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>GSA-X is not intended for children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy; any changes will be posted at this URL with a new “Last updated” date.</p>
